# Personal-Website
I've used WordPress to develop this website. I've added some sections like Instagram where you can find all my Instagram feeds, Resume where you can see my resume in a responsive way and can download it too and the last but not the least a blog section where i'll be posting now and then. 
In addition you can reply to my posts so that i can get your reviews and can solve if any querry is there. It's a fully responsive website which took me a while to develop but now it's finally up and running.
You can visit to www.kamalrajput.tk to see my awesome creation.
